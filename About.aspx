                <p>A hotel is an establishment that provides paid lodging on a short-term basis. Facilities provided may range from a modest-quality mattress in a small room to large suites with bigger, higher-quality beds, a dresser, a fridge and other kitchen facilities, upholstered chairs, a flatscreen television and en-suite bathrooms. Small, lower-priced hotels may offer only the most basic guest services and facilities.
                </p>
                <p>Larger, higher-priced hotels may provide additional guest facilities such as a swimming pool, business centre (with computers, printers and other office equipment), childcare, conference and event facilities, tennis or basketball courts, gymnasium, restaurants, day spa and social function services.
                                            Hotel rooms are usually numbered (or named in some smaller hotels and B&Bs) to allow guests to
                                            identify their room. Some boutique, high-end hotels have custom decorated rooms. Some hotels offer meals as part of
                                            a room and board arrangement. In the United Kingdom, a hotel is required by law to serve food and drinks to all guests
                                            within certain stated hours. In Japan, capsule hotels provide a tiny room suitable only for sleeping and shared
                                            bathroom facilities.

                <p>
                    The precursor to the modern hotel was the inn of medieval Europe. For a period of about 200 years from the mid-17th
                                            century, coaching inns served as a place for lodging for coach travelers. Inns began to cater to richer clients in
                                            the mid-18th century. One of the first hotels in a modern sense was opened in Exeter in 1768. Hotels proliferated
                                            throughout Western Europe and North America in the early 19th century, and luxury hotels began to spring up in the
                                            later part of the 19th century.
